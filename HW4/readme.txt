Problem 1
Partner was William Krantz.  Example images are in the folder 'server_images'.  William had access to the server before I added support for grayscale images.


Problem 2
The audio analysis is performed by the function analyzeSound(filename).  The function prints the notes found, and it also shows a plot of the frequency spectrum and the frequency spectrum recreated by finding peaks.  An explanation of how the function works can be found in its docstring, and plots of the output can be found in the folder 'audio_plots'.
