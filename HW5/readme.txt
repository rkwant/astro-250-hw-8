Astro 250 Problem Set 5

The problem set can be found in the ipython notebook political_db.  The first few cells construct the database, and then the last two do the plotting.

The database that I used can be found in db/politics.db.  To run the database construction code, either delete this file or change the filename in the third cell of the file.

Biographical data: for the purposes of this problem set, a candidate's hometown was considered to be the most recent place of residence that was not an official residence (ie Chicago, and not the Whitehouse), as long as such a place was listed.  

The plots that answer parts e and f of the problem set are entitled plote.png and plotf.png.  

e) We see that a candidate from the north (Romney or Obama) is almost 100% likely to win the republican race, and a candidate from the north (Romney) is most likely to the republican nomination.

f) The most interesting locations of inefficiency are found around May 1-12, 2011, and August 20, 2011.  Around May 12, 2011, I found that a study came out saying that many republicans wanted to create a third party.  This could be responsible for the sharp downward trend around May 9, 2010.  The general downward trend going into September is likely due to the fact that there were a number of candidates, and investors were not sure which one would get the nomination.  Starting in August, polls, such as the Ames Straw Poll, started occurring, and investors became more certain of which candidates were front-runners.
